This repository contains the source material for the spinoza-reader (temporary name) project.

As of now, this is not much more than a copy-pasted version of Wikisource's edition in latin, but metadata will be added in the form of embedded HTML inside the markdown files.

Markdown is mainly used here as a shorthand for HTML, with HTML blocks where necessary. It should be Commonmark compliant.
